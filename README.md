Hangman is a classic word-guessing game that can be made fun and interactive with a Python program. The program can start by selecting a random word from a pre-defined list, which the player then has to guess by suggesting letters. The program can keep track of the number of incorrect guesses and draw a gallows and hangman figure as the player progresses through the game. The program can also display the correctly guessed letters in their corresponding positions and provide feedback for incorrect guesses.
