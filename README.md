Hangman is a classic word-guessing game that can be made fun and interactive with this Python program. The program starts by selecting a random word from a pre-defined list, which the player then has to guess by suggesting letters. The program keeps a track of the number of incorrect guesses and draws a gallow and hangman figure as the player progresses through the game. The program also displays the correctly guessed letters in their corresponding positions and provides feedback for incorrect guesses.
